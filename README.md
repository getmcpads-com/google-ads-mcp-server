## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **35 read tools** | Campaigns, ad groups, budgets, bidding strategies, search terms, landing pages, Performance Max assets and placements, Shopping, recommendations, change history |
| **10 write tools** | Off by default. Status, budgets, bids, schedules, renames, campaign creation. Each one **previews before it applies** |
| **Full Keyword Planner** | Keyword ideas, historical metrics, forecasts, ad group themes, geo target suggestions |
| **130 metrics, 84 dimensions** | With a compatibility matrix that catches invalid combinations before they hit the API |
| **5 resources** | Live catalogues the model can read: metrics, dimensions, compatibility rules, 11 workflow recipes |
| **GAQL and beyond** | `google_ads_run_gaql` for raw queries, and `google_ads_run_readonly_rpc` for the services GAQL cannot reach |

### You do not need to know GAQL

The Google Ads API is queried with GAQL, its own query language, and most of its surface is
only reachable that way. This server carries the metric and dimension catalogues, so the model
asks for `cost` and `conversions` by name and the server writes the query.

`google_ads_validate_query` lets it check a combination before spending a call on it, and
`google_ads_run_gaql` is still there when you want to write GAQL yourself.

### Keyword Planner is not in GAQL

Keyword ideas, historical volumes and forecasts live in a separate RPC service that GAQL
cannot reach at all. Same for Reach Planner, audience insights and benchmarks. This server
covers them through `google_ads_run_readonly_rpc` and dedicated tools.

---

## Getting credentials

This is the heaviest setup of any advertising platform. Four values are needed, and one of
them requires a review by Google. Budget an hour the first time.

### 1. Developer token

From a **manager (MCC) account**, open **Tools → API Center** and apply for a token.
It starts at *Test Account* level, which only reaches test accounts. Apply for
**Basic Access** to reach live accounts. Google reviews the application, which can take a
few days.

📖 [Developer token documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token)

### 2. OAuth client

In a [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the **Google Ads API**,
then create an OAuth client under **APIs & Services → Credentials**. Choose **Desktop app**
for local use. Note the **client ID** and **client secret**.

### 3. Refresh token

Run the OAuth consent flow once, signed in as the Google account that can see your ad
accounts, and keep the **refresh token** it returns. Google's own helper script does this in
one command.

📖 [OAuth desktop flow](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/oauth/cloud-project)

**The refresh token does not expire.** It is the sensitive value here: anyone holding it can
mint access tokens indefinitely. Treat it like a password, and use an OAuth client dedicated
to this server so you can revoke it on its own.

### 4. Login customer ID, if you use a manager account

If the accounts you query sit under an MCC, set `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` to the manager
account ID. Dashes are accepted and stripped. Skip it for a standalone account.

You can also leave it unset. Google refuses any request against a managed account unless the
call names its manager, with a `USER_PERMISSION_DENIED` that mentions neither the account nor
the manager, so it reads as missing access rather than as a missing header. When the variable
is unset and the account you query is not directly accessible, the server asks the managers it
can reach which accounts they hold, and announces the one that holds yours. The answer is
resolved once and kept for the life of the process.

Setting the variable is still faster: it skips that discovery entirely, and it is the right
choice when every account you query sits under the same MCC.

Run **`google_ads_health_check`** as your first call. It verifies all four credentials, lists
the accounts you can actually reach, and reports what is missing, without printing any secret.

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-ads": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@getmcpads/google-ads-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "your-developer-token",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your-refresh-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Ask it: *"list my Google Ads accounts"*.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add google-ads --env GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=... --env GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=... --env GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET=... --env GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN=... -- npx -y @getmcpads/google-ads-mcp-server
```

### Cursor

`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project, same shape as the Claude Desktop config above.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getmcpads-com/google-ads-mcp-server.git
cd google-ads-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your credentials
npm start
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` | none | **Required.** From the API Center, Basic Access or above |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID` | none | **Required.** OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET` | none | **Required.** OAuth client secret |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN` | none | **Required.** From the consent flow |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` | none | Optional. Manager (MCC) account ID. Resolved automatically when unset |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_ENABLE_WRITES` | *unset* | Set to `1` to register the 10 write tools |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

Check your setup at any time:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

---

## Writes, and why they preview first

Write tools are **disabled by default**. Enable them with `GOOGLE_ADS_ENABLE_WRITES=1`.
Google's own server has none at all, so this is the part to read carefully.

When enabled, every write tool returns a preview and changes nothing:

```jsonc
// google_ads_update_campaign_budget { customerId: "123-456-7890", budgetId: "555", dailyAmount: 50 }
{
  "applied": false,
  "action": "google_ads_update_campaign_budget",
  "change": { "customer": "1234567890", "budget": "555",
              "newDailyBudget": 50, "inMicros": 50000000 },
  "message": "Preview only, nothing was changed. Repeat the same call with confirm: true to apply this change to the live account."
}
```

Only a second call carrying `confirm: true` touches the live account.

This is deliberate. An assistant composes these calls, and it can pick the wrong customer, the
wrong campaign, or the wrong order of magnitude on a budget. A mandatory preview makes the
mistake visible before it costs money, and gives a human the stopping point the protocol does
not guarantee on its own.

Two further guardrails:

- **`google_ads_create_campaign` always creates the campaign `PAUSED`.** There is no option to
  create it active. Someone has to look at it before it spends.
- **Amounts are converted to micros for you.** Google holds money in millionths, so 12.50 in
  the account currency is `12500000`. The preview shows both, so a factor-of-a-thousand
  mistake is visible before it applies.

| Tool | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `google_ads_update_campaign_status` / `google_ads_update_adgroup_status` | Pause, re-enable or remove |
| `google_ads_update_campaign_budget` | Daily budget |
| `google_ads_update_adgroup_bid` | Default CPC bid |
| `google_ads_update_campaign_schedule` | Start and end dates |
| `google_ads_rename_campaign` | Name only |
| `google_ads_create_campaign` | Creates a budget, then a campaign, always `PAUSED` |

## Security

This server holds a refresh token that never expires, a client secret and a developer token.
Concretely:

- **None of the four credentials is ever logged**, at any log level, or written to disk.
- **The access token is cached in memory** until a minute before expiry, rather than
  re-requested on every call.
- **Two hosts are contacted, and only two**: `googleads.googleapis.com` and
  `oauth2.googleapis.com`. *A test fails the build if a third host appears in the source.*
- **No fetch follows a redirect.** Every outbound call sets `redirect: "error"`, so a redirect
  cannot forward a bearer token or client secret to another host. *A test fails the build if
  any fetch omits this.*
- **No telemetry.** The server makes no network call other than to Google.
