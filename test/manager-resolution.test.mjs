/**
 * The manager account, resolved rather than configured.
 *
 * Google refuses any request against an account held by an MCC unless the call
 * names that MCC in `login-customer-id`. The refusal is a bare
 * `USER_PERMISSION_DENIED` naming neither the account nor the manager, so it
 * reads as missing access rather than as a missing header.
 *
 * `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` answers it when you already know. These tests
 * cover the case where you do not, and the sentence added to the error when
 * resolution could not help.
